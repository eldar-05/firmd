Bridge to Terabithia is one of those movies that, even years later, still resonates. It's a beautiful story about friendship, imagination, and finding magic in the mundane. It’s got such a raw, honest portrayal of childhood and growing up, and it's definitely a tear-jerker. It really makes you appreciate the power of connection and how important it is to have someone who understands your world, even if that world is completely made up.
